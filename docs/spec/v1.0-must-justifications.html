    <p class="small">
      This annex exists to make every <code>MUST</code> in the v1.0 specification auditable under hostile review.
      If a requirement cannot be defended with threat alignment and concrete failure consequences, it should not be a <code>MUST</code>.

    <strong>How to use this annex</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Use it as the first stop when questioning whether a <code>MUST</code> should be downgraded to <code>SHOULD</code>.</li>
      <li>Use the “Verification Method” column to convert disputes into testable claims.</li>
      <li>Submit contradictions or gaps via the <a href="/docs/independent-review.html">Independent Review</a> channel.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small"><strong>Controlled vocabulary:</strong> Threat tags are restricted to State surveillance, Institutional control, Network tampering, Device seizure, and Coercion / forced disclosure. Status values are restricted to Met, Partial, Not Met, and N/A. Partial means some mitigation exists, but the failure mode remains plausible under the stated threat.</p>
    <p class="small"><strong>Normative scope:</strong> This annex is non-normative rationale and evidence. The normative compliance surface remains the main specification at <a href="/docs/spec/v1.0.html">v1.0</a>.</p>

        <td>Environment: Latest release build. Access to state machine documentation (or equivalent state transition inventory), UI flows, API routes, and storage snapshot capability (IndexedDB/app data export). Action: (1) Generate a State Transition Inventory by enumerating all user-triggerable transitions (create, edit, delete, export, retention expiry, sync, reset, account change, device migration). (2) For each transition, classify as Reversible (explicit undo, restore, or rollback path exists) or Irreversible (no undo path). (3) For every Reversible transition: execute transition, execute documented recovery path, and capture before/after storage snapshot and UI state. (4) For every Irreversible transition: execute transition, attempt documented recovery path (if any), and confirm system communicates irreversibility clearly at time of action (UI capture required). (5) Compare observed reversibility behavior against documentation labels. Pass Criteria: Every documented state transition has an explicit reversibility classification. All Reversible transitions demonstrably restore prior state without residual data loss or hidden artifact persistence. All Irreversible transitions are clearly communicated before execution and behave irreversibly in practice. No transition behaves differently from its documented label. Fail Criteria: Any transition lacks classification. A labeled reversible action cannot be restored to its prior state. A labeled irreversible action can be partially undone without disclosure.

        <td>Environment: Clean install. Network inspector available. Access to app storage directory (or IndexedDB dump if web). Action: (1) Enumerate all persisted fields (schema + runtime writes) by exporting a storage snapshot after exercising every essential use-case workflow once. (2) For each persisted field, map it to the essential-use-case inventory ledger entry (field -&gt; necessity). (3) Validate encryption by extracting storage artifacts and confirming no plaintext values for sensitive fields are present at rest (string search or structured decode). (4) Validate transport: if any network sync exists, capture outbound requests and confirm TLS-only transport and no sensitive fields appear in request bodies without encryption-at-application-layer where claimed. (5) Run retention test: set retention window to minimal value (test config), create records, wait past window, then snapshot storage and confirm records are absent or cryptographically unrecoverable within application access paths. Pass Criteria: Every persisted field has a necessity mapping; no plaintext sensitive values present at rest; no sensitive values transmitted in clear; records past retention window are not accessible and do not appear in storage snapshots. Fail Criteria: Any persisted field lacks necessity justification; any sensitive value appears in plaintext at rest or in transit; retention-expired records remain accessible or persist in storage.</td>

If the system has no network endpoints by design, verification is a negative test (no outbound). Action: (1) Identify every network endpoint used by the product (sync, updates, telemetry, third-party APIs) by running essential workflows while capturing traffic. (2) For each endpoint, run a TLS posture scan and record: supported protocol versions, ciphers, key exchange, certificate chain, HSTS (if web), and renegotiation behavior. (3) Attempt downgrade: force TLS 1.2 and weak cipher negotiation from the client side (scanner-supported). (4) Attempt plaintext: confirm no HTTP (non-TLS) endpoints are reachable for the same host/path patterns. (5) Inspect captured traffic payloads for sensitive field names/values (string search or structured decode) to ensure no application-layer plaintext is sent where encryption-at-application-layer is claimed. Pass Criteria: All observed endpoints require TLS; no HTTP reachable equivalents. TLS 1.0/1.1 not supported; TLS 1.2 allowed only if explicitly justified; TLS 1.3 preferred. Weak ciphers/legacy key exchange rejected. Downgrade attempts fail (handshake refused or negotiation prevented). No sensitive values appear in captured request/response bodies in clear where app-layer encryption is claimed. Fail Criteria: Any endpoint allows plaintext HTTP. TLS downgrade succeeds or weak suites negotiate. Any sensitive values observed in clear contrary to the spec disclosure/crypto claims.</td>

(2) Generate a Data Egress Matrix including destination domain, data categories transmitted, triggering action, and consent prerequisite (if any). (3) Toggle all consent states (opt-in/opt-out combinations) and repeat full essential workflow run while capturing traffic. (4) Compare observed outbound data to documented processor list and privacy documentation. (5) Inspect request payloads for sensitive fields not explicitly documented as shared. Pass Criteria: Every outbound data transmission maps to a documented processor and declared purpose. No sensitive data is transmitted when consent state disallows it. No undocumented third-party endpoints receive user data. Network capture matches documented data-flow inventory. Fail Criteria: Any outbound transmission occurs without documented consent linkage.
