(4) Run a Dark-Metric Probe by inspecting shipped UI/flows for engagement mechanics inside essential workflows (nudges, streaks, upsells, nags, continue traps) and confirm whether those mechanics are tracked as success signals. (5) Verify decision precedence: from last 2 cycles, pick 2 roadmap decisions and trace justification metrics, confirming outcome-based justification rather than engagement-based justification. Pass Criteria: Primary success metrics are dominated by Outcome/Goal Completion measures, and each essential workflow has at least one outcome metric with explicit threshold. Engagement metrics, if present, are non-primary, explicitly labeled non-goal, and not used to justify shipping that affects essential workflows. No engagement/extraction mechanics are embedded in essential workflows as measured success drivers. Fail Criteria: Any primary metric is engagement/extraction without outcome linkage. Essential workflows lack outcome metrics or thresholds. Roadmap decisions are justified primarily by engagement metrics or feature adoption without outcome evidence.","Met","Reference mapping states outcome-oriented success measures and explicitly rejects DAU/time-in-app as primary targets.","v1.0","666"

Core Principles (Normative) | 4.6 Essential Utility","sec4","/docs/spec/v1.0.html#sec4","MUST NOT require payment for essential features (accessibility tiers acceptable; never paywall core utility)","Institutional control","Paywalling essential functions creates coercive access barriers for vulnerable users and undermines protective utility.","Essential capability access must remain non-discretionary; optional anti-paywall policy invites monetization harm.","Environment: Fresh user profile in Free tier state. No paid entitlements. Network inspector and feature flag visibility if applicable. Action: (1) Define the canonical Essential Workflows List (from spec/annex) as the test plan. (2) Execute each essential workflow end-to-end under Free tier: create/read/update/delete core records, review history, export minimal clinician-ready summary (if defined essential), and access safety-critical settings (privacy controls, deletion, retention). (3) During execution, capture UI state (screenshots/log), network calls (to detect paywall checks), and runtime errors or blocked routes. (4) Attempt deep-link navigation directly to essential workflow endpoints/routes to detect soft gating (paywall only on entry path). (5) Confirm pricing/entitlement matrix matches observed runtime behavior (no mismatch between documented free and actual blocked features). Pass Criteria: Every essential workflow completes in Free tier without paywall, degraded lockout, or hidden gating; no essential endpoint is blocked by entitlement checks (UI or API); entitlement matrix matches observed runtime behavior. Fail Criteria: Any essential workflow is blocked, paywalled, rate-limited to unusability, or requires payment to complete; any essential route is blocked via entitlement enforcement; documented pricing differs from runtime gating.","Met","Reference mapping indicates no premium paywall on core utility and transparent funding model without data-harvest monetization.","v1.0","668"
