# Field Guide v0.1 is Live

Protective Computing now has a second citable artifact.

- Foundation artifact: **The Overton Framework v1.3** (DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18688516)
- Practice artifact: **Field Guide v0.1** (DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18782339)

## Why this release matters
The Overton Framework defines the doctrine and constraints.
The Field Guide operationalizes those constraints for systems engineers implementing real systems under hostile and degraded conditions.

## Relationship to v1.3
- **v1.3 (Overton Framework):** normative posture and principle-level architecture.
- **v0.1 (Field Guide):** implementation-facing execution companion.

Together they provide a clearer bridge from principle to engineering practice.

## Call for case studies
We are now collecting implementation case studies from teams building in vulnerability contexts (health, crisis response, journalism, civil society, public-interest tooling).

What to share:
- threat context and operating constraints,
- architecture decisions tied to principles,
- verification evidence (pass/fail outcomes),
- failures and lessons learned.
